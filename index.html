[Intro]
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love? Yeah-yeah
(Ooh, ooh)
        
[Verse 1]
No, I don't know why you're not there
I give you my love, but you don't care
So what is right and what is wrong?
Give me a sign
        
[Chorus]
What is love?
Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Oh, baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
        
[Post-Chorus]
Woah-woah-woah-woah
Oh-woah-woah, uh-huh
Woah-woah-woah-woah
Oh-woah-woah, uh-huh
